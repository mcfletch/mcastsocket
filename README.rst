Migrating from `zeroconf.mcastsocket`
--------------------------------------

If you've been using the `forked zeroconf mcastsocket module <https://github.com/mcfletch/pyzeroconf>`_, just update your 
imports from::

    from zeroconf import mcastsocket 

to::

    from mcastsocket import mcastsocket 

and your code should continue to work.

Credits

The original "how to work with multicast" code comes from PyZeroconf. The mcastsocket
module is largely new-code, but it does derive from the original PyZeroconf, so retains
its license (LGPL).
